=== GTK+3

Although we are at GTK+3, we have many older documentations for GTK+2 but not enough ones for GTK+3.

Those older documentations for GTK+2 contain useful contents as long as they are used carefully.

For pure C programs, migrating from GTK+2 to GTK3+ is basically as easy as
changing from "gtk+-2.0" to "gtk+-3.0" in `pkg-config` argument.  In case of
troubles such as missing `GtkObject` and many missing GDK API issues, see
http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.0/migrating.html[GTK+ 3 Reference Manual:
Part V. Migrating from Previous Versions of GTK+].

Here are basic references:
